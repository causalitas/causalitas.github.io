We meet weekly to discuss interesting causality texts drawn from a wide range of literature. In each meeting, we choose an essay which all members of the group read. Then, a single discussant walks through the material, and we have a broader group discussion.

## Meeting time

We are still discussing the day of the week and time which are the best for the group. If you are interested in joining us, please submit your proposition through a form availabe [here]().
