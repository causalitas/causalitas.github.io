## Courses

* [Causal Diagrams: Draw Your Assumptions Before Your Conclusions](https://www.edx.org/course/causal-diagrams-draw-assumptions-harvardx-ph559x)

	> Causal diagrams have revolutionized the way in which researchers ask: Does X have a causal effect on Y? They have become a key tool for researchers who study the effects of treatments, exposures, and policies. By summarizing and communicating assumptions about the causal structure of a problem, causal diagrams have helped clarify apparent paradoxes, describe common biases, and identify adjustment variables. As a result, a sound understanding of causal diagrams is becoming increasingly important in many scientific disciplines.
	
	> **What you'll learn with this course:**
	
	> * How to translate expert knowledge into a causal diagram
	> * How to draw causal diagrams under different assumptions
	> * Using causal diagrams to identify common biases
	> * Using causal diagrams to guide data analysis

* [A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality)

	> At the end of the course, you will be able to:
	> 
	> 1.  Define causal effects using potential outcomes
	> 1.  Describe the difference between association and causation
	> 1.  Express assumptions with causal graphs
	> 1.  Implement several types of causal inference methods (e.g. matching, instrumental variables, inverse probability of treatment weighting)
	> 1.  Identify which causal assumptions are necessary for each type of statistical method

* [Center for Causal Discovery Summer Short Course 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO5mmwQolPRX858CyOOIHqYnmdzlHjIgS)
	
	> Overview of graphical models, loading Tetrad, Causal graphs and interventions
* [Causal & Statistical Reasoning](http://oli.cmu.edu/courses/all-oli-courses/causal-statistical-reasoning/)

  > This course provides an introduction to causal and statistical reasoning. After taking this course, students will be better prepared to make rational decisions about their own lives and about matters of social policy. They will be able to assess critically—even if informally—claims that they encounter during discussions or when considering a news article or report. A variety of materials are presented, including Case Studies where students are given the opportunity to examine a causal claim, and the Causality Lab, a virtual environment to simulate the science of causal discovery. Students have frequent opportunities to check their understanding and practice their skills.
  
  > This course is meant to serve students in several situations. One, it is meant for students who will only take one such research methods course, and are interested in gaining basic skills that will help them to think critically about claims they come across in their daily lives, such as through a news article. Two, it is meant for students who will take a few statistics courses in service of a related field of study. Three, it is meant for students interested in the foundations of quantitative causal models: called Bayes Networks.

## Videos & Lectures

* [Four Lectures on Causality](https://stat.mit.edu/news/four-lectures-causality/)

	> - Part 1: We introduce structural causal models and formalize interventional distributions. We define causal effects and show how to compute them if the causal structure is known.
	> - Part 2: We present three ideas that can be used to infer causal structure from data: (1) finding (conditional) independencies in the data, (2) restricting structural equation models and (3) exploiting the fact that causal models remain invariant in different environments.
   > - Part 3: If time allows, we show how causal concepts could be used in more classical machine learning problems.

* [The Mathematics of Causal Inference: with Reflections on Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/bcRl7sXR1hE)
   > The development of graphical models and the logic of counterfactuals have had a marked effect on the way scientists treat problems involving cause-effect relationships. Practical problems requiring causal information, which long were regarded as either metaphysical or unmanageable can now be solved using elementary mathematics. Moreover, problems that were thought to be purely statistical, are beginning to benefit from analyzing their causal roots.
